dmenu_tutorial
==============

This is intended as a tutorial about using dmenu as a multi-purpose menu and information bar.

Needed for this is the program dmenu written by the suckless.org guys, and some practice in shell-scripting.

First see the Information bar. There I'll tell you a bit about the basics.

Afterward you should try the menu options of dmenu.
